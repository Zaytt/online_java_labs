Answer the following questions:

1.) What is a thread and why do we use them?
    It's a part of program that can run concurrently with another.
    They are used to make more time efficient programs that benefit from the idle CPU time that some
    programs may have.
2.) What are the two ways to create a thread?
    By implementing the interface "Runnable" or by inheriting the "Thread" class.
3.) How do you start a thread using the Runnable interface?
    1. Implement the runnable interface on a class and implementing the run() method.
    2. Instantiating an object of that class.
    3. Creating a Thread object that constructs on the previous Runnable class.
    4. Calling the start() method from the thread object.
    Steps 2 & 3 can be done at the same time by creating the Thread right at the constructor of the class.

    Then instantiating that class and calling the start() method.
4.) How do you start a thread using the Thread class?
    1. Create a class that inherits the Thread Class.
    2. On the class constructor make a call to the parent class constructor by using super() and also call the start()
        method;
    3. Override the run() method.

5.) How do you change a thread priority?
    By using the method setPriority(int level), where level is the level of priority given to a thread, 1
    being the lowest and 10 the highest.
