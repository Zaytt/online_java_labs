Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?
    It's a property of Java that allows classes to obtain the properties of a parent class.

2.) Why do we use inheritance?
    To facilitate sharing properties among related classes and saves coding time.

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.
    A catalog of Minerals. Where you would have a "Mineral" parent class followed
    by more detailed subclasses like "sulfide", "carbonate", "oxide", "nitrate", "sulfate", etc.
    Each with their own special characteristics.

4.) How does a class inherit another class?
    Using the keyword "extends" followed by the name of the parent class.

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?
    Multiple

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?
    To refer to the parent class. This way the subclass can call the parent class methods.

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?
    They execute the parent classes constructors first.

8.) What is method overwriting?
    It is a way to redefine a method that was specified on a parent class, so a subclass can specify
    that method to it's need or rewrite it completely.

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?
    It can be beneficial when a subclass needs to add additional functionality to a method or when while it
    delivers the same outcome, it needs to be addresses quite differently than in the parent class.
