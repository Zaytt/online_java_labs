Answer the following questions:

1.) Why do we use generics?
    To make a class that can perform the same functionality on multiple data types instead of writing a class
    for each data type.
2.) What is type erasure?
    It's when the compiler replaces all the type parameters with their bound or with Object if unbounded.
3.) What is an example of a generic class that we have seen in the past?
    ArrayList<>
4.) Can an interface be generic?
    Yes and it must be applied to a generic class.
5.) What are bound and unbound generic types?
    They are generics that can accept any type of data in the case of unbounded.
    Bounded generics are those that can only use a specific set of data types; this is done by
    declaring that the generic type inherits certain data type.
