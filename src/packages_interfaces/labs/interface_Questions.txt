Answer the following questions:

1.) What is an interface?
    It's a type of file in Java that specifies a certain behavior & characteristics that the
    classes that implement the interface will adopt.
2.) Why are interfaces implemented?
    To assure that a class implements the functions of the interface. This allows the "One interface, multiple methods"
    of polymorphism in Java, as each class that implements the interface can define how the interface's methods will
    be executed.
3.) What is the implement keyword used for?
    To assign an interface to a class
4.) How many interfaces can class implement?
    Any
5.) Write a simple interface with one method.
    public interface myInterface{
        public void method1();
    }
6.) Think of a real world application where interfaces are used. Describe it's purpose.
    A unit on a RTS game. Every unit would have basic functions and characteristics that then could be expanded
    and specialized by a class that implements that interface.
7.) What is wrong with the following interface?

    public interface IncorrectInterface{
        int sum(int x, int y){
            return x + y;
        }
    }

    Its implementing a method without the default keyword.
