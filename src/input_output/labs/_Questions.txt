Answer the following questions:

1.) What is a byte stream?
    -It's an interface that allows the user to read and write raw bytes form and into files and other input/output
    devices. It read one byte at a time.
2.) What is a character stream?
    -It's similar to a byte stream but it read 2 bytes at at time, converting the 16 bits to a readable character.
3.) What two classes are at the top of the the byte stream hierarchy?
    -InputStream & OutputStream
4.) What two classes are at the top of the the character stream hierarchy?
    -Reader & Writer
5.) List at least three byte stream classes.
    -BufferedInputStream
    -BufferedOutputStream
    -PrintStream

6.) List at least three character stream classes.
    -BufferedReader
    -BufferedWriter
    -FileReader
    -FileWriter

7.) What is a try-with-resources?
    -It's a variation of try-catch where a stream or "resource" will be defined at the try and it will be closed
    automatically at the end of the try. This saves time and lines of code compared to closing the stream manually
    on every instance of the try-catch.
8.) What makes the BufferedReader different from the BufferedInputStream?
    -Buffered reader is designed to read characters and it's more efficient at it than BufferedInputStream,
    which is designed to read raw bytes.
9.) When would you use the read() method vs. the readline() method?
    -read() reads one character at a time, while readLine() reads a complete sentence.
    Thus readLine() is better used when a it's more important to read whole words or sentences.
