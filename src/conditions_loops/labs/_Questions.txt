3.) What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
    The do-while will execute at least once, because it evaluates the condition at the end of the loop.

    break is used to exit a loop .
    continue is used to jump to the next iteration of a loop.
7.) Is there a limit to how many loops you can nest?
    No, but the method will grow in complexity with each nest.
8.) Is there a limit to how many conditional statements you can nest?
    No, but the method will grow in complexity with each nest.
